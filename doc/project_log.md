I forgot about the project log before this point. Before this, I read the resources that I was going to use to figure out the structure of my report. I skimmed the proofs to get a general understanding, leaving the details for later.

Read the two main proofs used for the finite breakdown point of S-estimators, from the "Robust Statistics" textbook by Maronna, Martin, Yohai, and Salibian-Barrera (2019) and the original S-estimators paper by Rousseeuw (1982). Expanded parts of the proof by Rousseeuw on the existance of S-estimators, particularly the part on the median bound. The proof in the paper doesn't contain much detail.

Found a more detailed proof on the existance of the least median of squares regression estimator by Rousseeuw (1982) in a Robust Statistics textbook by Rousseuw and Leroy (1987). The proof of the existance of S-estimators uses this proof. Worked my way through this proof in detail, found the geometric construction used in the proof quite complicated.

Made what I hope is a correct, but more concise, variation on the existance of the least-median of squares regression estimator.
